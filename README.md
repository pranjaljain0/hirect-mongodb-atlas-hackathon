### Description

For this application I have build an application on Flutter as a native mobile for both android and IOS, The backend for the app is made in ExpressJS with multiple libraries to debug APIs written. The app uses basic design as I didnt focus on design of the application, And then I created comphrensive APIs for doing multiple operations.

## Background

As I am pursuing my masters right now in computer science, I found that the current portals miss few things Which I tried to add in my application, Like status update on my applications, Job posting rating and reviews and more features.

### How I built it

As it was a very comphrensive application. I created APIs using ExpressJS. There I have used a modular approach where I divided endpoints in multiple modules which had there own multiple function which were in turn performing mongoDB operations.
